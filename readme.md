# foundation model
## text to text generation 
This project demonstrates how to use a foundation model, specifically Google's FLAN-T5, for text-to-text generation tasks such as summarization, translation, paraphrasing, explanation, and question generation. It utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to load a pre-trained FLAN-T5 model, designed to understand prompts in natural language and generate relevant outputs.

By simply modifying the input prompt, users can perform various NLP tasks without needing to train a model from scratch. This makes it a powerful tool for educational bots, content generation, and conversational AI systems.
## text to image generation 
This project showcases how to generate high-quality images directly from natural language prompts using the Stable Diffusion foundation model. Powered by Hugging Face’s diffusers library and PyTorch, this model turns your creative ideas into stunning visuals — all with just a few lines of text.

Whether you're dreaming up sci-fi cities, fantasy landscapes, or aesthetic vibes for a mood board, Stable Diffusion transforms imagination into imagery using deep learning magic.
